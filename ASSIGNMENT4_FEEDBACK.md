Hi Isabelle!

Fantastic work!

As you can see below you've done everything you needed to do to get a VG grade. Congratulations!

I made a few code style comments, and have a look into the background-size (especially background-size: cover;) and background-repeat: no-repeat; properties. It would like a lot betteer if there was just one image covering th background, rather than the same image repeated multiple times.

Well done, this works great!

       <p class="h"> WTF is an 'h'?!? Try to make the class names mean something to the perso reading it. In this case "page-title" would be better!

  CSS - a few unneeded empty lines, but very good!
